				<h2>The Basic Idea</h2>
				<p>First, memorize a sequence of words.  Always say them in the same order.  If you want to count a bunch of things, say this sequence while you point at each thing -- one word for each thing.  The last word you say tells you how many things there are in the group.

				<p>Now, there are problems with counting that I won't address here.  If the cats are moving around, it may be hard to know which ones you've already counted.  Maybe one or five of them left already, and you wanted to count them, too.  That's not a math problem so much as a cat problem.

				<h2>The Foundation</h2>
				<p>The counting numbers, also known as natural numbers (or positive integers) are the beginning of our understanding of numbers.

				<h2>The Decimal System</h2>
				<p>Our decimal system makes it easy to work with counting numbers, in many ways you only have to learn how to count to ten:  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
